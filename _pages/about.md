Hello, my name is Rohit Gangurde. I am currently a junior studying Computer Science at Boise State University.
I am an international student who came to the States in 2017 from Nashik, India. My interest in Computer Science peaked in 9th grade. I started to explore different aspects of Computer Science and thereafter, I ran into Machine Learning. I have done various courses on DataCamp to learn about different techniques in the field and working on various projects to fulfill my curiosity and build up experience. I am interested in the intersection of ML and other fields. I am currently working at the Idaho Transportation Department as a Data Analytics Intern. It's all about Python, SQL and little bit R at my workplace.

Have a look at my profile by browsing through projects and my resume. Feel free to contact me at [rohitgangurde@u.boisestate.edu](mailto:rohitgangurde@u.boisestate.edu) for projects or research work.
