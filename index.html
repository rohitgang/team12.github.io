<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>In this project, we aimed to iterate upon existing results for autonomous crack detection, segmentation, and tracking in pavement provided to us by Dr. Yang Lu. We began by manually training our own version of YoloV5 and a semantic segmentation repo by annotating a subset of the images weâ€™d been given by Dr. Lu. Once we had done that, the rest of the annotating/training could be done automatically. Using these trained models of crack detection, we added in new features for classifying the cracks based on size and shape. Having these more specific crack detections can be used to prioritize which cracks should be fixed/looked at first in the future and thus save time, money, and labor.</p>

<p>This website is being updated and will be updating till we reach our project goals. Check out our project's github profile
